Question: Explain how the adapter design pattern binds the client to an interface not a concrete implementation?
<br>
Answer: By providing an abstract interface that both the client and the adapter implement, the adapter pattern ties the client to an interface rather than a specific implementation. Through this abstract interface, which protects it from any modifications made to the adapter's internal implementation, the client communicates with the adapter using it.<br>
